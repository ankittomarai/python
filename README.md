This repository contains Python code which I developed during my learning from different resources. Practicing these coding files can help you to improve your Python skills

## Learn Problem solving in python
Most of the time, we tend to learn syntax in an assumption that we know the language. But the ultimate goal is to build problem solving skills using programming language and it can only come when you start solving problem. One such good platform is Leetcode.com 

If you want to build up the skills, you must keep solving problems at Leedcode or similar platform. 
This excercise can make you an artist on coding, Thats where the actual fun starts.  

Cheers! 
Keep Learning
